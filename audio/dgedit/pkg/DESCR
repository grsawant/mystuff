Dgedit contains all essentials for importing, editing and exporting the raw
drumkit recordings are there. The editor is certainly a huge help when
creating the individual drumkit instruments (snare, kickdrum, toms, crashes
and so on). The entire process of taking a bunch of wav files that you've
recorded using, for instance, 16 microphones and then converting them into
working instruments with hit energy levels is fully supported.

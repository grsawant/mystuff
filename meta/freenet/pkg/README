| ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD

To start Freenet:

  $ rcctl start freenet

This will create new files in /var/freenet directory tree. To interact
the web interface execute a browser of your choice and open
127.0.0.1:8888

Freenet stores all the downloaded material in /var/freenet/downloads

As of the 0.7.5.1488 release freenet keeps its configurations in
/var/freenet/conf/freenet.ini.

Avoid unloading the plugins with 'Remove plugin from cache' option,
since it simply deletes it.

When you use freenet to change your configuration the above file is
updated. Make sure freenet is not running when you manually edit the
file ; if freenet is running it might overwrite your file.

NOTE: The OpenBSD freenet port may not be compatible with plugins loaded
from the freenet network.
